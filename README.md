# Uber-Trip-Analysis---Power-BI
Analyse Uber trip data using Power BI to gain insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip efficiency, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

# KPI’s
1.	Total Bookings – How many trips were booked over a given period?
2.	Total Booking Value – What is the total revenue generated from all bookings?
3.	Average Booking Value – What is the average revenue per booking?
4.	Total Trip Distance – What is the total distance covered by all trips?
5.	Average Trip Distance – How far are customers traveling on average per trip?
6.	Average Trip Time – What is the average duration of trips?

## Expected Outcomes:
✔ Identify trends in ride bookings and revenue generation.
✔ Analyse trip efficiency in terms of distance and duration.
✔ Compare booking values and trip patterns across different time periods.
✔ Provide insights to optimize pricing models and improve customer satisfaction.

#CHART’s
Create a Measure Selector using a Disconnected Table with the following values:
•	Total Bookings
•	Total Booking Value
•	Total Trip Distance
Then, use a measure to dynamically update the visualizations based on user selection.
By Payment Type (Card, Cash, Wallet, etc.)
By Trip Type (Day/Night)

## Additional Enhancements:
- Dynamic Title – Update the chart title based on the selected measure.
- Slicers – Add filters for Date, City, and other interactive filters for deeper analysis.
- Tooltips – Show additional details like Average Booking Value or Trip Distance.

## Vehicle Type Analysis - Grid View in Power BI
Create a grid table (matrix or table visual) to analyse key performance indicators like Total Bookings, Total Booking Value, Avg Booking Value, Total Trip Distance across different Vehicle Types in Uber trips.

## Power BI Implementation:
- Use a Table or Matrix Visual to display Vehicle Type with the KPIs.
- Apply Conditional Formatting to highlight high and low values.
- Enable Sorting & Filtering for user interaction.

## Total Bookings by Day
- Detecting trends and fluctuations in daily trip volumes.
- Identifying peak and off-peak booking days.
- Understanding the impact of external factors (holidays, events, weather) on ride demand.
- Supporting strategic planning for resource allocation and pricing adjustments.
